Hi, I'm Tom. I'm interested in games and game design, music and pixel art.
In programming my interests are in:
  - Optimisation
  - Rendering
  - Physics
  - Memory Management


I'm currently looking into SDL as I have been enjoying making random 2D games/simulations in pygame and would like some more power.
